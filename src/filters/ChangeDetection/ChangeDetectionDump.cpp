/*
 * This function takes the result of the ChangeDetection algorithm

 * their GmlId (the ID found in CityGML). Because this identifier is
 * not unique across different time stamps, a general identifier is
 * build out of the input time stamps (refer to to_global_id() function).
 * At this level of abstraction (where geometry is set aside) the
 * correspondance between buildings considered at two time stamps can
 * be seen as a graph where the nodes are the building identifiers and
 * the edges the correspondences between old and new building.
 * Such a graph can be expressed in THE de facto standard graph format
 * that is GraphML. Nevertheless we here chose to use the Json adaptation
 * of  GraphML instead of its standard XML format.
 * Refer to e.g.
 *   https://github.com/gregors/graphml2json
 *   https://github.com/uskudnik/GraphGL/blob/master/examples/graphml-to-json.py
 * If you want true Graphml, use boost's ptree::write_xml() instead of
